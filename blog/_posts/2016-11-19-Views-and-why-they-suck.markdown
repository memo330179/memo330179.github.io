So I thought it would be a good idea to create my own dashboard,
and I think that I did an okay job. I thought that it would just be fun
to get the information from the database and display it for the user so that they
could see it. I like writing the backend, but the views are just so weird. HTML
and bootstrap are nice tools to create quick prototypes, but they are very quirky.
If anything to needs to be dynamic, it needs to be written in jquery. I can do html,
and I can do javascript, but doing HTML in JavaScript is not something I want to do.
Trying to write HTML in javascript is just string manipulation, and that is boring.
